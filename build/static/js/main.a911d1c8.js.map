component\n * state to another _over time_ with a simple declarative API. Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

This may also be a \"lazy initializer\" function, which should return an initial state value when called. This will be used whenever the reducer is called with `undefined` as its state value, and is primarily useful for cases like reading initial state from `localStorage`.\r\n * @param actionsMap - An object mapping from action types to _case reducers_, each of which handles one specific action type.\r\n * @param actionMatchers - An array of matcher definitions in the form `{matcher, reducer}`.\r\n *   All matching reducers will be executed in order, independently if a case reducer matched or not.\r\n * @param defaultCaseReducer - A \"default case\" reducer that is executed if no case reducer and no matcher\r\n *   reducer was executed for this action.\r\n *\r\n * @example\r\n```js\r\nconst counterReducer = createReducer(0, {\r\n  increment: (state, action) => state + action.payload,\r\n  decrement: (state, action) => state - action.payload\r\n})\r\n\r\n// Alternately, use a \"lazy initializer\" to provide the initial state\r\n// (works with either form of createReducer)\r\nconst initialState = () => 0\r\nconst counterReducer = createReducer(initialState, {\r\n  increment: (state, action) => state + action.payload,\r\n  decrement: (state, action) => state - action.payload\r\n})\r\n```\r\n \r\n * Action creators that were generated using [`createAction`](./createAction) may be used directly as the keys here, using computed property syntax:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst increment = createAction('increment')\r\nconst decrement = createAction('decrement')\r\n\r\nconst counterReducer = createReducer(0, {\r\n  [increment]: (state, action) => state + action.payload,\r\n  [decrement.type]: (state, action) => state - action.payload\r\n})\r\n```\r\n * @public\r\n */\r\nexport function createReducer<\r\n  S extends NotFunction<any>,\r\n  CR extends CaseReducers<S, any> = CaseReducers<S, any>\r\n>(\r\n  initialState: S | (() => S),\r\n  actionsMap: CR,\r\n  actionMatchers?: ActionMatcherDescriptionCollection<S>,\r\n  defaultCaseReducer?: CaseReducer<S>\r\n): ReducerWithInitialState<S>\r\n\r\nexport function createReducer<S extends NotFunction<any>>(\r\n  initialState: S | (() => S),\r\n  mapOrBuilderCallback:\r\n    | CaseReducers<S, any>\r\n    | ((builder: ActionReducerMapBuilder<S>) => void),\r\n  actionMatchers: ReadonlyActionMatcherDescriptionCollection<S> = [],\r\n  defaultCaseReducer?: CaseReducer<S>\r\n): ReducerWithInitialState<S> {\r\n  let [actionsMap, finalActionMatchers, finalDefaultCaseReducer] =\r\n    typeof mapOrBuilderCallback === 'function'\r\n      ? executeReducerBuilderCallback(mapOrBuilderCallback)\r\n      : [mapOrBuilderCallback, actionMatchers, defaultCaseReducer]\r\n\r\n  // Ensure the initial state gets frozen either way (if draftable)\r\n  let getInitialState: () => S\r\n  if (isStateFunction(initialState)) {\r\n    getInitialState = () => freezeDraftable(initialState())\r\n  } else {\r\n    const frozenInitialState = freezeDraftable(initialState)\r\n    getInitialState = () => frozenInitialState\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function reducer(state = getInitialState(), action: any): S {\r\n    let caseReducers = [\r\n      actionsMap[action.type],\r\n      ...finalActionMatchers\r\n        .filter(({ matcher }) => matcher(action))\r\n        .map(({ reducer }) => reducer),\r\n    ]\r\n    if (caseReducers.filter((cr) => !!cr).length === 0) {\r\n      caseReducers = [finalDefaultCaseReducer]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return caseReducers.reduce((previousState, caseReducer): S => {\r\n      if (caseReducer) {\r\n        if (isDraft(previousState)) {\r\n          // If it's already a draft, we must already be inside a `createNextState` call,\r\n          // likely because this is being wrapped in `createReducer`, `createSlice`, or nested\r\n          // inside an existing draft.
