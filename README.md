# Turbo Shell DEX Aggregator - Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange

Turbo Shell presents as a premier DEX Aggregator specially tailored to calculate and manage the best rates for cryptocurrencies across a variety of participating exchanges.

Tokens available to Turbo Shell are categorized on the basis of mock tokens deployed via Solidity code, representing native cryptocurrencies on various fictitious exchanges (DAPP, APPL, USD), as well as the forked testnet version of publicly-listed tokens (DAI, WETH).

Turbo Shell is wired to manage for all possibilities which involve trading tokens on either side of this equation, and strategically selects between exchange rates before successfully seeding out the appropriate swap requests, using interface commands as needed to query public router addresses for both Uniswap and Sushiswap.

Turbo Shell, along with participating exchanges Dapp Swap and Apple Swap, comprise the final project for the Dapp University mentorship program and is made to expand upon knowledge acquired therein for learning purposes.
